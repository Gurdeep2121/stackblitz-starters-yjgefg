  <p className='mx-10 my-2 pb-2 text-2xl'>Welcome to the Official About Page of the New York Knicks!</p>

  <p className='mx-10 my-2'>Founded in 1946 as one of the original teams of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949, the New York Knickerbockers—known fondly as the Knicks—are one of the most storied franchises in NBA history. Based in the heart of New York City at the iconic Madison Square Garden, the Knicks have woven a rich tapestry of basketball history that resonates with the spirit of the city they call home.</p>

  <p className='mx-10 my-2 pb-1 font-bold underline text-orange-600 text-2xl'>Our Heritage</p>
  <p className='mx-10 my-2'>The Knicks are not just a basketball team; they are a symbol of New York tenacity and resilience. The team name, Knickerbocker, traces back to the pseudonym used by Washington Irving in his book, A History of New York, reflecting an integral part of the city early history. This deep connection to the city roots is evident in the team commitment to embodying New York diverse and dynamic culture on and off the court.</p>

  <p className='mx-10 my-2'>Throughout their history, the Knicks have been known for their gritty play, no more so than during the golden era of the 1970s under the guidance of Coach Red Holzman. The Knicks secured two NBA Championships in 1970 and 1973, with legendary players like Willis Reed, Walt Clyde Frazier, and Earl The Pearl Monroe, whose playing styles and on-court prowess encapsulated the spirit of New York.</p>

  <p className='mx-10 my-2 pb-1 font-bold underline text-orange-600 text-2xl'>Modern Era</p>
  <p className='mx-10 my-2'>In more recent years, the Knicks have been rebuilding and reshaping their identity with a focus on developing young talent and fostering a culture of success. With a mix of seasoned veterans and promising newcomers, the Knicks are committed to building a team that can compete at the highest levels of the NBA. The franchise's leadership under the stewardship of dedicated executives strives to enhance the teams performance through strategic decisions both on and off the court.</p>
